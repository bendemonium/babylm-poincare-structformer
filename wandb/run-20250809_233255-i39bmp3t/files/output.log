jax.errors.SimplifiedTraceback: For simplicity, JAX has removed its internal frames from the traceback of the following exception. Set JAX_TRACEBACK_FILTERING=off to include these.

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):

    loss = eval_step(state.params, state.apply_fn, x, m)
TypeError: Error interpreting argument to <function eval_step at 0x74252465d630> as an abstract array. The problematic value is of type <class 'method'> and was passed to the function at path apply_fn.
This typically means that a jit-wrapped function was called with a non-array argument, and this argument was not marked as static using the static_argnums or static_argnames parameters of jax.jit.
